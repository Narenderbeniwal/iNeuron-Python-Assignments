    "The only difference is that (a) the body of a lambda can consist of only a single expression, the result of which is returned from the function created and (b) a lambda expression is an expression which evaluates to a function object, while a def statement has no value, and creates a function object and binds it to a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda functions: are operator can have any number of arguments, but it can have only one expression. It cannot contain any statements and it returns a function object which can be assigned to any variable. They can be used in the block they were created.\n",

    "Recursive functions allow programmers to write efficient programs using a minimal amount of code. The downside is that they can cause infinite loops and other unexpected results if not written properly. For example, in the example above, the function is terminated if the number is 0 or less or greater than 9. If proper cases are not included in a recursive function to stop the execution, it will repeat forever, causing the program to crash or become unresponsive.\n",
