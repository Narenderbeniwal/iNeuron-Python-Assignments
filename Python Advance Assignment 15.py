# ## Q.1 What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?
# 
# Sol :
#     Python 3.8 adds some new syntax to the language, a few minor changes to existing behavior, and mostly a bunch of speed improvements — maintaining the tradition from the earlier 3.7 release.

# ## Q. 2 What is monkey patching in Python?
# 
# Sol: In Python, the term monkey patch refers to dynamic (or run-time) modifications of a class or module. In Python, we can actually change the behavior of code at run-time.

# ## Q.3 What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?
# 
# A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. 
# 
# A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.

# ## Q.4 What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?
# 
# In Python, the highest possible length of an identifier is 79 characters

# ## Q.5 What is generator comprehension?
# 
# Sol: A generator comprehension is a single-line specification for defining a generator in Python. It is absolutely essential to learn this syntax in order to write simple and readable code. Note: Generator comprehensions are not the only method for defining generators in Python.
